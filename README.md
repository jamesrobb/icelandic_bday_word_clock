icelandic_bday_word_clock
=========================

This is the code for a home made word clock that displays the time in the icelandic language. 

I borrowed some of the code, and a lot of the inspiration from the following github page and imgur gallery respectively:

It is powered by an Arduino. That is all.... except this... and this... and finally this.
