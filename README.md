icelandic_bday_word_clock
=========================

This is the code for a clock that displays the time as it would be spoken in the icelandic language using a grid of LEDs and a laser cut face with the appropriate letters.

The current build is for a new design involving a circuit board of my own design where the neopixel LEDs are used for all the LEDs in place of just their use for the happy birthday message. This new code is still arduino compatible as I have mimicked an arduino setup on my circuit board.

Please check out the 0.1v for the software that worked with an arduino and shift registers along with the appropriate credits for the inspiration of that particular design.
